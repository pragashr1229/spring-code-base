Spring Bean :
In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. 
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.


1. Spring Bean Scope Types
    1.1. singleton scope
    1.2. prototype scope
    1.3. request scope
    1.4. session scope
    1.5. application scope
    1.6. websocket scope

singleton scope 
	– spring container creates only one instance of the bean, by default.
	– it is cached in memory
	– all request for the bean will return shared reference to the same bean

Coach theCoach = context.getBean(“theTennisCoach”,Coach.class);

Coach theCoach1 = context.getBean(“theTennisCoach”,Coach.class);
theCoach, theCoach1 both addresses are same

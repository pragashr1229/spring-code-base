Problems of JDBC API
The problems of JDBC API are as follows:

We need to write a lot of code before and after executing the query, such as creating connection, statement, closing resultset, connection etc.
We need to perform exception handling code on the database logic.
Repetition of all these codes from one to another database logic is a time consuming task.

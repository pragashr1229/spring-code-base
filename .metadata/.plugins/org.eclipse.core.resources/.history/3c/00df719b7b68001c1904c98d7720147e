Problems of JDBC API
The problems of JDBC API are as follows:

We need to write a lot of code before and after executing the query, such as creating connection, statement, closing resultset, connection etc.
We need to perform exception handling code on the database logic.
Repetition of all these codes from one to another database logic is a time consuming task.

Spring JdbcTemplate Tutorial
============================
Spring JdbcTemplate is a powerful mechanism to connect to the database and execute SQL queries. 
It internally uses JDBC api, but eliminates a lot of problems of JDBC API.

Spring framework provides following approaches for JDBC database access:
JdbcTemplate
NamedParameterJdbcTemplate
SimpleJdbcTemplate
SimpleJdbcInsert and SimpleJdbcCall

JdbcTemplate class
It takes care of creation and release of resources such as creating and closing of connection object etc. So it will not lead to any problem if you forget to close the connection.

It handles the exception and provides the informative exception messages by the help of excepion classes defined in the org.springframework.dao package.

We can perform all the database operations by the help of JdbcTemplate class such as insertion, updation, deletion and retrieval of the data from the database.
